# Explainable Brain Tumor MRI Classification

This repository contains the implementation of an **explainable deep learning model** for brain tumor MRI classification.  
The goal is not only to achieve accurate predictions but also to provide **interpretable visual explanations** that highlight the MRI regions most responsible for each decision.

## Abstract
The increasing use of deep learning in medical imaging raises concerns about the interpretability of AI-driven diagnoses.  
This project explores an approach to brain tumor classification that integrates explainability tools such as **Grad-CAM** and **LIME**, enabling visual insight into the model’s reasoning.  
By visualizing attention regions, the project aims to bridge the gap between model accuracy and clinical interpretability.

### Research Question:
How can deep learning models for brain tumor classification be made more reliable and clinically interpretable without compromising diagnostic accuracy?

---

## Methodology
1. **Dataset**: Public Brain Tumor MRI dataset (7,000+ labeled 2D scans).  
2. **Preprocessing**: Image normalization, resizing, and augmentation.  
3. **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for multi-class classification.  
4. **Explainability**: Grad-CAM and LIME to visualize the model’s decision-making regions.  
5. **Evaluation**: Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) and interpretability analysis.
